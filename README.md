# CGP
Cartesian Genetic Porgraming Algorithm; C++ implementation
This program is realizing CGP algorithm on user-defined class.

## \(E)Sense of CGP
CGP evolves genotype of "operations" of given "object type" so that,
when input parameters are passed, the graph of operations process those
inputs into desired outputs. 

CGP operates on acyclic graph of operations set over cartesian (square) grid.
Each node proceses two inputs into one output.

Fitness function describes similarity of output to desired output and creates
an offspring based on that fitness function

## Course of implementation
This implementation should provide a class to be inherit from to implement
user-defined type of object that CGP will manipulate and user-defined
operaations that CGP will perform on those objects
